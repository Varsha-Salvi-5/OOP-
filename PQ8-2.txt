Chapter No 8 Practice Question 2

Q: Q. Can the private members of a class be inherited? If yes, how will they be inherited?
Answer:
No, Members of a class that are declared private are not inherited by subclasses of that class. Only members of a class that are declared protected or public are inherited by subclasses declared in a package other than the one in which the class is declared. The answer is No. They do not.
